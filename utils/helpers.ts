This month we are focusing on Humility.</p></li><li><p>To be humble is to recognize gratefully our dependence on the Lord—to understand that we have constant need for His support. Humility is an acknowledgment that our talents and abilities are gifts from God. It is not a sign of weakness, timidity, or fear; it is an indication that we know where our true strength lies. We can be both humble and fearless. We can be both humble and courageous. Jesus Christ is our greatest example of humility. During His mortal ministry, He always acknowledged that His strength came because of His dependence on His Father. He said: “I can of mine own self do nothing. … I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” The Lord will strengthen us as we humble ourselves before Him. James taught: “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. … Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”</p></li></ul><hr><h1 style="text-align: center"><strong>Tupelo Stake Announcements</strong></h1><ul><li><p>Tupelo Stake General Priesthood Meeting - Sunday August 25th 3:00 PM - Tupelo Stake Center (1085 South Thomas Street)</p></li><li><p>All men and boys regardless of age are invited to attend.</p></li><li><p>Refreshments will be served following the meeting.</p></li><li><p>You are invited to listen and ponder the words of hymn #1004 "I will walk with Jesus" in preparation for the meeting.</p></li><li><p>Doctrine and Covenants 84:20-21 "Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.

What do you know of your ancestors and relatives who may have fought to preserve freedoms and way of life? What discovery clues do their records contain?<br><br>While working with my mother on our own family history, it was the military records of a family member which allowed us to verify and confirm several pieces of his family\'s story. The records verified his various residences, confirmed that he was single throughout his life, and mentioned his next of kin so that we could clearly see that it was indeed our family member and not another soldier with the same name.
